# Falcon sometimes topples over after landing. Would it help to add wires that could quickly support it, or cushions for it to fall on?

The Falcon booster is over 40 meters tall (as tall as a 13 story building), and weighs approximately 20 tonnes. Any structure 'catching' the booster would need to close very rapidly, and so the forces involved in manipulating an object of this size are huge. The rocket body is as thin as a scaled up coke can, and not designed to handle sidewards forces. In addition, the 'catching structure' would need to be very far out to avoid getting caught on the legs as they came down, particularly if the rocket was off center.

The trouble with surrounding the pad with a soft surface for the booster to fall onto is it'll need to be very close to where the booster lands, and it won't be able to land directly on the soft surface. As a result of this, it dramatically shrinks the possible landing area, making a botched landing all that more likely. In addition, the fragile booster likely won't survive falling on its side, no matter how soft the landing.

We know it's fun to think about ways to fix a problem, but this is a problem that is easily fixed by improving the robustness of the current system, so that everything works as designed. SpaceX's goal is to develop the technology needed to land on other surfaces than the earth, where there will be no pre-built landing support systems.
