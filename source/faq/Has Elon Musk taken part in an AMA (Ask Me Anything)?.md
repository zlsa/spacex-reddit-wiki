# Has Elon Musk taken part in an AMA (Ask Me Anything)?

Three times. Elon Musk recently did an AMA in r/SpaceX in October 2016, discussing SpaceX's Mars Architecture, [which you can read here](https://redd.it/590wi9).

In January 2015, Musk hosted a more conventional AMA in r/IAmA, discussing SpaceX, [see the thread here](http://www.redd.it/2rgsan).

Musk hosted a video AMA in September 2011, also in r/IAmA, touching on a number of topics. ([Thread](http://redd.it/kkn5v), [Video Responses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzoqMz9QfEg)).

Musk has promised to participate in a fourth AMA as soon as a landed Falcon is relaunched, which was scheduled for NET late 2016.
