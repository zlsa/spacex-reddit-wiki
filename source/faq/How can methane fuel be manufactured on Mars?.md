# How can methane fuel be manufactured on Mars?

Methane and oxygen can be manufactured on Mars, using the resources already present on the red planet (this is known as In-Situ Resource Utilisation). By taking the abundant (96%) carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere, and hydrogen either imported from Earth, or hydrolysed from Martian permafrost, it is possibly to chemically react the two together in such a way to produce fuel and oxidiser. These can then be burned together as propellant for orbital launch, or in a rover engine for getting around on the surface, or for warmth in a habitat. Furthermore, the oxygen is extremely useful for creating a breathable atmosphere, and methane can be used as a feedstock for producing plastics. As a side product, carbon monoxide can be used for low-temperature smelting of metals.

The exact process in question is the [Sabatier reaction](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabatier_reaction), which makes use of the abundant carbon dioxide in the Martian atmosphere. The overall equation for making methane and oxygen fuel is as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 CO*_2_* + 2 H*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 O*_2_* + C

This is actually several different reaction steps combined into one:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CO*_2_* + 4 H*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 H*_2_*O

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 H*_2_*O → 2 H*_2_*+ O*_2_*

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CH*_4_* → C + 2 H*_2_*

Alternatively, you have the reverse water gas-shift reaction, which is as follows:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 H*_2_* + 3 CO*_2_* → CH*_4_* + 2 O*_2_* + 2 CO
