# How much does SpaceX spend lobbying Congress?

In 2015, SpaceX spent over $1.3 million on lobbying ([source](http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/space-star-wars-elon-musk-boeing-lockheed-martin-217182)), and $1.5 million in 2014 ([source](http://spaceksc.blogspot.co.uk/2015/07/house-for-sale.html)). This is more than their rival ULA directly spent ($900k in 2015, $1 million in 2014), though possibly less when you take into account ULA's parent companies Boeing and Lockheed Martin, who each spend over $10 million apiece.
