# What is falling off the rocket just after liftoff?

Water ice. As the LOX tank of Falcon is extremely cold, ice builds up on the outside skin of the launch vehicle - condensed from the warm, humid surrounding air. It's an inevitable but harmless result of storing cryogenic materials in uninsulated tanks (it isn't a big enough problem to be worth the extra weight and bulk of adding insulation). Naturally, as it isn't firmly attached to the rocket, a lot of it ends up falling off during ascent due to the vibrations and aerodynamics of launch, and can be frequently seen falling away on the camera feed. Backlit against the glow of the rocket engines, it can make for a very photogenic sight!
