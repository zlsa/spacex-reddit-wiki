# What is ITAR?

ITAR is the [International Traffic in Arms Regulations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Traffic_in_Arms_Regulations), which control export and import of defense-related articles on the United States Munitions List.  As it applies to SpaceX, it means that SpaceX cannot disclose any specific information that would aid a foreign national in building a rocket, that includes satellite providers. This has the side effect of meaning that SpaceX cannot land their rockets on foreign soil, preventing a downrange landing in the Caribbean for a Cape Canaveral launch, for example.
