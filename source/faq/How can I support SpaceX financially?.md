# How can I support SpaceX financially?

The easiest way to support SpaceX monetarily is to purchase from their [online store](http://shop.spacex.com/), which can also help to advertise them and boost their brand visibility. As shares in the company are not for sale (unless you are a venture capitalist, with significant resources to invest), and they do not accept donations, it's difficult to directly invest. It is possible to *indirectly* invest in SpaceX, by buying shares in one of their investors, but exactly how much of this money will actually end up in SpaceX is anyone's guess.
