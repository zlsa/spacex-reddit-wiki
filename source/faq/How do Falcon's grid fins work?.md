# How do Falcon's grid fins work?

Grid fins are a type of flight control surface. Conventional planar control fins are shaped like miniature wings, whereas grid fins are instead a lattice of smaller aerodynamic surfaces arranged within a box. Grid fins perform very well at subsonic and supersonic speeds, though poorly at transonic speeds. However, at high Mach numbers, grid fins flow fully supersonic and can provide lower drag and greater maneuverability than planar fins. See [this article](http://www.aerospaceweb.org/question/weapons/q0261.shtml) for a full explanation of their operation. Falcon has four of these fins, attached just above the LOX tank at the bottom of the interstage, at 90 degree angles to each other.

The grid fins have undergone redesigns since first being used, including different geometries and fabrication methods.
