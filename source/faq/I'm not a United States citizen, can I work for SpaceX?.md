# I'm not a United States citizen, can I work for SpaceX?

In general, it is more difficult to find work at SpaceX if you weren't born in the US. It is only possible to work at SpaceX if you are classified as "US Person", which means you need to be a citizen, naturalized citizen, or legal permanent resident. The reason why SpaceX avoid hiring foreign nationals is ITAR, which controls the exchange of certain  types of information, including rocket design. If SpaceX decide you are worth the effort, they may sponsor you to get a Green Card, and Canadian citizens have found work at SpaceX by possessing a TN Visa and an ITAR exemption license. The official SpaceX wording is as follows (from a typical job posting):

> To conform to U.S. Government space technology export regulations, applicant must be a U.S. citizen, lawful permanent resident of the U.S., protected individual as defined by 8 U.S.C. 1324b(a)(3), or eligible to obtain the required authorizations from the U.S. Department of State.
