# Does SpaceX have any operations outside of the United States?

Because of ITAR limitations, SpaceX is unlikely to have any operations outside the U.S. for the foreseeable future. It is possible they might create a sister company that develops things not subject to ITAR at some point, but the vertically integrated nature of SpaceX makes this unlikely.
