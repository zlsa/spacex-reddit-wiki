# Does SpaceX manage this subreddit?

No. This community is 100% run by fans, for fans. No posts or comments should ever be construed as official SpaceX statements, unless they have come from a verified, flaired user who is making an official SpaceX statement. For official SpaceX news, please visit spacex.com.

Note that occasionally we will, provided we are given a legitimate request, remove content from this subreddit at request of third parties. This is done to ensure a good working relationship with these third parties.
