# What will colonists do to stop Mars' terraformed atmosphere being lost to the solar wind?

While it is true that the solar wind has stripped Mars of much of its original atmosphere (due to the lack of the planet's magnetic field), and that any man-made atmosphere on Mars would eventually be dissipated by the solar wind - the speed at which this occurs is measured over geological time frames - on the scale of tens, if not hundreds of millions of years. If humanity were to create an artificial, life-conducive atmosphere on Mars, any atmospheric output due to economic activity (CO*_2_* + other gases) would easily exceed any atmospheric losses. Thus, the atmosphere would be stable.
