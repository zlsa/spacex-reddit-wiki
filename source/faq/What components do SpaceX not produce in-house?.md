# What components do SpaceX not produce in-house?

[See this interesting thread from May 2014](http://redd.it/24o5pf) for more details. Objects such as Dragon's ECLSS, some equipment (for thermal analysis), and sheet metal for parts are all sourced out of the company. The Merlin engine turbopumps used to be produced by Barber-Nichols, but these were eventually brought in-house for the Merlin-1D.
