# How can I get a tour at SpaceX?

Tours aren't open to the general public, and you can only get one if you are personally invited by a SpaceX employee; or have NASA or Air Force accreditation. However, please **do not request invites** from the employees who browse here, as it annoys them, and there's too much potential for it to go wrong. In order to visit SpaceX property, you have to be a US person (Citizen, Naturalized Citizen, or LPR) due to ITAR requirements (though exceptions have been made). However, everyone is welcome to watch the following video tours of the [Hawthorne factory](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQ6tZtGrShg), the [McGregor test site,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bdvv8qIl_WI) and the [Cape Canaveral launch site.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FlhbMraqxA)
