# I'm online. Where can I watch the launch, what streams should I watch, and how can I participate in the discussion?

Yes! [r/SpaceX](http://reddit.com/r/spacex) hosts a regular "launch discussion and updates" thread for each SpaceX launch. You can freely comment and participate however you like, with relaxed subreddit rules. This thread is stickied to the top of the subreddit about 2-3 days before and after a launch. After launch, and to receive more technically-detailed updates, follow along on Twitter using our list of useful Twitter accounts on the [resources page](http://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/wiki/resources). Additionally there is an r/SpaceX IRC channel which you can [join here](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.esper.net/#SpaceX).

You can watch the launch live from a number of different locations:

* [SpaceX on YouTube (Hosted + Technical Webcasts)](https://www.youtube.com/user/spacexchannel)

* [r/SpaceX Live](https://rspacex.com/live) contains all the available streams to watch in a multitude of formats, with streaming text updates from the moderators and from Twitter.

* [SpaceX.com (YouTube Hosted Webcast)](http://spacex.com/webcast)

* NASA, NOAA, & DoD payload launches are also streamed on [NASA TV](http://www.nasa.gov/multimedia/nasatv/)

SpaceX hosts two webcasts on YouTube; the **hosted webcast** and the **technical webcast**. If you are new to rocketry or SpaceX, and would like a more guided experience with explanations about what is happening, be sure to watch the hosted webcast. For enthusiasts who would rather listen in to the launch loop communications and watch the rocket without the newscasters, choose the technical webcast. SpaceX webcasts usually go live roughly 20-30 minutes before liftoff - please note the countdown timer on the YouTube webcasts counts down to the *launch*, not the webcast beginning. NASA TV usually begin 1-2 hours before launch if it is a NASA-managed launch, and will not feature SpaceX hosted commentary. If you experience problems getting a steady stream try selecting a lower quality or bitrate.
