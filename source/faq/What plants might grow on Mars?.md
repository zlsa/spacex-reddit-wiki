# What plants might grow on Mars?

All higher plants would die in Mars' current state. Some plants (lichens, mosses) might tolerate Mars' cold periods, and grow only in the warmer >0 °C periods, but they'd grow very slowly, and have virtually no effect on the planet. All plants need oxygen, which Mars lacks. Plants on Earth have evolved to live in an oxidising atmosphere with a reducing soil. Mars has the exact opposite (no oxygen in the atmosphere, far too many perchlorates in the soil), which would need to be remedied by chemical processes before plants can take a hold, processes sped up by warming the planet. Marian soil is rich in inorganic nutrients, but has zero organic nutrients, so it'd be like when plants colonise volcanic soil on Earth. The rules of biological succession show that simple plants will arrive first, colonising the area in successively complex waves until higher plants can survive. The Isle of Surtsey is a good example.
