# What is PICA-X? Does PICA-X ablate?

PICA stands for 'Phenolic Impregnated Carbon Ablator', and yes it does. It was the material used to coat the Stardust capsule that returned to Earth from interplanetary velocities in 2006, and was patented by NASA in the 1990's for use on the mission as no other heatshield material would be able to withstand the extreme heat and speeds that the mission heatshield would be required to handle (70% faster than the Space Shuttle, faster than Apollo). *Ablative heatshields* work by allowing small amounts of the heatshield material to evaporate in the extreme heat of reentry, which counter-intuitively protects the heatshield structure and capsule by directing the heat into the evaporated material, rather than the heatshield proper.

SpaceX improved on this heatshield design by producing PICA-X, which is both easier and cheaper to manufacture, and also ablates less significantly, allowing for more reuse. PICA-X versions 1 & 2 have been used on Dragon CRS missions to the ISS. Dragon 2 employs PICA-X version 3, which ablates even less. Because of the PICA heritage, SpaceX claim a capsule equipped with PICA-X can be reused from Lunar or Martian velocities "dozens of times" before requiring replacement.
